      <h1>Record-challenging heat to build over Southwest, including over 100 F in Phoenix</h1>

        <p>
            Temperatures will throttle up over the southwestern United States into this weekend with some of the highest temperatures of the year so far for many areas across the interior, DailyWeatherNews meteorologists say. The string of hot, dry days will boost the spring wildfire risk in the region. 
Temperatures will run 10-20 degrees Fahrenheit above historical averages at the peak, with records challenged. Factoring in April sunshine, which is equivalent to sunshine in August, DailyWeatherNews RealFeelÂ® Temperatures can spike to 10 degrees or more above the actual temperature during the day. "A strong area of high pressure will bring unusual warmth for this time of year for the rest of this week and this weekend," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Heather Zehr said, "The high looks strongest from Wednesday through Friday, then weakens a bit this weekend as it slides eastward."
        </p>

        <p>
            Phoenix is likely to experience its first 100 F or higher reading of the year on Thursday," Zehr said, "Friday and Saturday may also top 100.

The average date for the first 100 is May 2 at Phoenix. The earliest date was March 26, 1988.

For outdoor enthusiasts who will be venturing out in the wilderness over the next week or so, be sure to pack plenty of water, as the sun and heat in remote areas can have deadly consequences.

In California, the interior will get very warm, but sea breezes will keep coastal areas relatively cool, and there can be some short-lived fog along and near the coast to start each day.
        </p>

        <p>
            The core of the heat will begin to shift farther to the east over the Southwest this weekend.
"There is a chance an eddy forms just offshore of Southern California, which is a common phenomenon in June," Zehr said.

The counterclockwise circulation around the eddy can direct long-lasting cool, damp air with clouds and drizzle toward Southern California beaches and even to the Interstate 5 corridor. "If that eddy forms, coastal areas could be cloudy, drizzly and chilly for days, just like it often occurs in June," Zehr explained.        </p>
